// --------------------------
// Layout
// --------------------------
// Layout is global - it is responsible for visual structure on every page. To
// stay consistent it is neccessary to treat it as separate layer.
// Layout can also be very specific project to project. First, you need to make
// an audit, understand how it works, which variations exist and how they
// behave. With that knowledge you then can prepare it.
// It goes without saying, but still - don't use any magic number, fixed
// dimensions.

// Decouple components from layout, so they're as portable as possible. Levarage
// markup - use wrappers around components and style layout through those. Of
// course though, if the project is special and it makes more sense different
// approach, go for it.
